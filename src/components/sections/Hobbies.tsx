        During my holidays I love traveling on my bike across Europe. I also
        like running and cycling a lot. I am periodically training and generally
        attend a few competitions of trail running, cycling and triathlon during
        summer. I am also a member of the Swiss Alpine Club where I learned ski
        touring. When I started working, I spent my first money in brewing
        equipment, it's been a while now since I last brewed a batch but I will
        get back to it for sure!
